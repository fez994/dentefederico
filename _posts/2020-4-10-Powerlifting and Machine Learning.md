# Powerlifting and Machine Learning 

## 1.0 Introduction   

I spent the last week studying machine learning, algorithms, data analysis and statistics. Iâ€™m a firm believer that the best way to learn something is by doing. This is the result of my first machine learning project using Scikit-Learn, MatPlotLib and Pandas.  

Objectives:  

- Using Machine Learning to predict the strength level of an Athlete based on Gender, Bodyweight, Weight Class and TotalKg lifted.   

- Better understand the level of athletes that partake in Powerlifting competition 

## 1.1. Context  

The dataset that I used is a snapshot of the OpenPowerlifting Database as of April 2019. OepnPowerlifting is creating a public-domain archive of powerlifting history. Powerlifting is a sport in which competitors compete to lift the most weight for their class in three separate barbell lifts: Squat, bench and Deadlift.
