## 1.0 Introduction   

I spent the last week studying machine learning, algorithms, data analysis and statistics. Iâ€™m a firm believer that the best way to learn something is by doing. This is the result of my first machine learning project using Scikit-Learn, MatPlotLib and Pandas.  

Objectives:  

- Using Machine Learning to predict the strength level of an Athlete based on Gender, Bodyweight, Weight Class and TotalKg lifted.   

- Better understand the level of athletes that partake in Powerlifting competition 

## 1.1. Context  

The dataset that I used is a snapshot of the OpenPowerlifting Database as of April 2019. OepnPowerlifting is creating a public-domain archive of powerlifting history. Powerlifting is a sport in which competitors compete to lift the most weight for their class in three separate barbell lifts: Squat, Bench and Deadlift.  

## 2.0 Summarize Data

Machine learning algorithms learn from data. It is critical that I feed them the right data for the problem i want to solve. Even if I have good data, I need to make sure that it is in a useful scale, format and even that meaningful features are included.
Let's take a quick look into the OpenPowerlifting data: 

```
import pandas as pd

dataset = pd.read_csv('openpowerlifting.csv', low_memory=False)
print(dataset.shape)
print(dataset.head(10))

```
